As part of our course work in CG2, we were asked to do some work with Pixar's Renderman software. We were given a set of basic shaders and were asked to modify them.

Here are the results:

As the second part of the assignment we were asked to use three different shaders we found online in our scene.

Here is our exploration into the unknown:
