Well I've fallen in love.

I've spent the last week planning development of [Foxnight.net](https://www.foxnight.net "Foxnight. net").

Final conclusion? [Foxnight.net](https://www.foxnight.net "Foxnight.net") is obsolite. The functionality can and should be worked into [JosephBauser.net](https://www.josephbauser.net "JosephBauser.net").

So I've started a redesign of [JosephBauser.net](https://www.josephbauser.net "JosephBauser.net") and managed to develop a simple layout that I think I can finally be happy with. As a part of this redesign, the site will be reworked from a simple PHP app, into a bit more robust [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org "Ruby") on [Rails](https://www.rubyonrails.org "Rails") application.

As a part of this process, as can be imagined, I've learned quite a bit more about [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org "Rails") and [Rails](https://www.rubyonrails.org "Rails"). I've spent the last few weeks frequenting the Rochester on Rails users group, and can't help but getting more and more excited. Such a powerful and easy to understand language, combined with such a balanced framework like [Rails](https://www.rubyonrails.org "Rails") is a dream to work in.

I do have a development schedule for this rework, but that will stay my little secret for now.

I can't wait to see how this goes.
