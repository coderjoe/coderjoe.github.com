This can be considered the FIRST POST for my Foundations of 2D Graphics journal. It's purpose being to chronicle my experiences developing our project for Foundations of 2D Graphics! I'm psyched. In the future all of the journal entries can be viewed via the blog category "Foundations of 2D Graphics Journal"Foundations of 2D Graphics Journal", or by accessing the blog directly.
