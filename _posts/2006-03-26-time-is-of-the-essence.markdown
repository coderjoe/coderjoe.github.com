Or at least it was.

Yet again I've missed my release dates, mostly because of a still ambitious release schedule, coupled with more school work, and a bit of lack of resolve in design. I did manage to get [JosephBauser.net](https://www.josephbauser.net "JosephBauser.net") in layout form released on time, but [Foxnight.net](https://www.foxnight.net "Foxnight.net") has fallen behind again.

With this in mind I've adjusted my schedule accordingly.

Foxnight.net will be finished by the end of week 5 in this quarter.

I've begun writing up a preliminary schedule which I'll use to plan development phases and release deliverables.
