Working on transmission we had something which to us looked correct. However tonight we realized that it was only "correct" looking by a double fluke error in our code. In trying to fix the problem we've found error after error in our transmission algorithm we're working to fix. 

Here's what we have thus far:

As we fix it we'll update this article. 

Hopefully we'll finish it soon. :(
