So what does any self respecting programmer do when he finds himself awake at 2am after Thanksgiving?

Do some coding of course!

In this case I decided to finish up that holiday shopping budget I had been putting off. Using this simple little javascript application you can tell exactly how much you can afford to spend on each person.

Just choose your overall max budget, enter the names of all those people you will be giving gifts to, and rate them on a scale from 1 to 10!

Easy as pie.

Happy Holidays!
