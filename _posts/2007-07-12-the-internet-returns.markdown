For the past week or so I've been without a reliable internet connection. But now, I'm proud to say we have a reliable means of digital communication!

Now that I can get on the web I can get back to work on my Nintendo DS development and tutorial writing.

For those of you who I know are waiting on my tutorials keep in mind that the [devkitPro website](http://www.devkitpro.org "The Devkit Pro Website.") contains a good many tutorials in their [FAQ](http://www.devkitpro.org/faq.shtml "The Devkit Pro FAQ page.") and [Setting Up](http://www.devkitpro.org/setup.shtml "The Devkit Pro \"Setting Up\" website.") websites (which I will be citing information from). So if you just can't wait to get up and running, I highly suggest visiting their site.
