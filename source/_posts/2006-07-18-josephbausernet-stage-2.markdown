Stage 2 was released on sunday.

"But it looks the same!", you cry. 

That's the point. ;)

The front end is finally completed, though some of the UI Design (Projects in particular) is still rudimentary. The back end has been integrated, and the site is fully functional. I'm still tweaking the admin page, but since that doesn't effect you, the reader, it doesn't really matter so much. 

With that done it's time to move onto my next project. :)
