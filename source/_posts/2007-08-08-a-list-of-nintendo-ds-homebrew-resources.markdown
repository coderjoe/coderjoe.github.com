I was asked recently what resources I use as references while developing Nintendo DS homebrew. 

As such I've decided to collect my favorite links in a single post for your enjoyment.  ( Please keep in mind that I am also new to the Ninendo DS development scene, and as such this post is by no means a complete list of all of the resources available to you. )

If you know of any killer resources that I'm missing please feel free to let me know and I'll add them to the list.

** Hardware References:**

- [NDSTech Wiki](http://www.bottledlight.com/ds/ "More information than you'd ever need to know about the Nintendo DS's hardware.") - The de-facto Nintendo DS Hardware Doc.
- [GBATek Specifications](http://www.work.de/nocash/gbatek.htm "The GBATek GBA hardware documentation, with a little bit of information about the NDS as well.") - The de-facto GBA Hardware doc (with some NDS thrown in for good measure)

**Tutorials: **

- [dev-scene. com tutorials](http://www.dev-scene.com/NDS/Tutorials "Dev-Scene. com's programming tutorials. While incomplete, the sections that are finished are very useful.") - The official dev-scene. com tutorials. Incomplete but thorough.
- [PataterSoft Introduction to NDS Programming](http://www.patatersoft.info/manual.php "Provides a step by step look into Nintendo DS 2D game programming with example code.") - A step-by-step introduction to Nintendo DS 2D game development with examples.

**Library References:**

- [libnds documentation](http://devkitpro.sourceforge.net/devkitProWiki/libnds/index.html "The libnds doxygen documentation.") - Libnds documentation as generated by doxygen. Excellent autodocs.

**Communities:**

- [dev-scene.com](http://www.dev-scene.com "The dev-scene. com website.")
- [Drunken Coders](http://www.drunkencoders.com "The Drunken Coders website.") - The guys who brought you many (if not all) of the nds-examples code!

That's all I've got for now. If you feel I'm missing something important please let me know!

Code away.
