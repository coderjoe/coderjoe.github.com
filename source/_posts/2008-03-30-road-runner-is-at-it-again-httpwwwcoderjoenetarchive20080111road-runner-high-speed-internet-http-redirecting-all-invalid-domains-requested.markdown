After writing my [first post](/archive/2008/01/11/road-runner-high-speed-internet-http-redirecting-all-invalid-domains-requested/ "My fist post describing the idiotic ") describing Road Runner's annoying practice of redirecting all invalid DNS requests to their own advertising laden search page I opted out. I figured that would be the end of it. 

I was wrong. 

As of this morning Road Runner ha re-enabled the DNS redirecting again. 

How stupid are they? At least now I know how much they actually actually care about their user's settings. 

Road Runer, if you're reading this. Stop turning this feature on. It's absolute rubbish and I really don't want it. When I opt-out of a service this does NOT mean you should re-enable it a few months later and hope I won't notice.
