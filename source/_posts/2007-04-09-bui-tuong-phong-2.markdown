Dear Dr. Phong,

As Computer Science students wetting our feet in the realm of 3D ray-tracing, I can't help but feel we're standing on the shoulders of giants. You've provided us with this amazing approximation of synthetic lighting. We love it. We implemented it for our ray-tracer.

Thank you for everything.

Love,

Team More Bloom
