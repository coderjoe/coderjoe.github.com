**Oh no! You killed it!**

When I purchased my first domain I had a nifty idea for a particularly useful and exciting web application. It was to be the be-all and end-all of all my internet needs. 

Then I realized that my idea sucked harder than a vacuum. 

Since then the domain has been sitting around gathering dust, and generally wasting space. People have suggested that I sell the domain, but I've decided to just give it to the first person to  give me a good reason why it should be theirs.

**How can I get it from you?**

- First, you need whatever the transfer costs for your registrar.
- Second, you need a good reason why you should be the lucky one to own [Foxnight. net](http://www.foxnight.net "Foxnight.net").

Ok, so the reason doesn't have to be amazing. Your reason just needs to beat the many "because I want it" reasons I've been receiving. 

Want to do something good with the domain? Going to start a business? Want to own your first domain and think it sounds neat?

Let me know!

Contact me via my e-mail address at coderjoe[squiggily-a]coderjoe.net with your reason, and if I like it we'll get the transfer process started. 

I'll leave this post up for as long as it takes to catch someones interest.  Once the domain has a new owner I'll note it at the top of this post.
