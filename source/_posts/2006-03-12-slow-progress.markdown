It would seem that I've overestimated the amount of time I had available over the past two weeks.. this has in turn increased the expected development time of [josephbauser.net](http://www.josephbauser.net "JosephBauser.net") and [foxnight.net](http://www.foxnight.net "Foxnight.net"). Expected basic layout and minimal site release dates have been pushed back another week. The tentative schedule is now as follows:

Saturday March 18th - JosephBauser.net initial site release

Saturday March 25th - Foxnight.net initial site release

The following week will be beta-testing for both sites. 

I'm hoping that the impending class load which begins Monday will not slow development too much.

Cheers for development.
