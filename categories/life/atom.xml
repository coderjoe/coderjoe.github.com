<p>If it's a clear night, go outside, check out the night sky you'll be surprised what you can see.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.earthhour.org" title="Earth Hour 2009">Earth Hour 2009</a></p>

<p>From their <a href="http://www.earthhour.org/about" title="about page">about page</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>"What began as a campaign to get Sydneysiders to turn their lights off, has grown to become one of the world's biggest climate change initiatives. In 2009, at 8. 30pm on March 28, people around the world will turn their lights off for one hour Earth Hour. We're aiming to reach one billion people, more than 1000 cities, all joining together in a global effort to show that its possible to take action on global warming.</p>

<p>Earth Hour started in 2007 in Sydney, Australia with 2.2 million homes and businesses turning their lights off for one hour. Only a year later and this event had become a global sustainability movement with up to 50 million people across 35 countries participating. Global landmarks such as the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, Rome's Colosseum and the Coca Cola billboard in Times Square, all stood in darkness, as symbols of hope for a cause that grows more urgent by the hour."</p></blockquote>

    <id>http://coderjoe.net/archive/2008/09/03/google-chromes-terms-of-service-they-want-your-stuff</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>UPDATE: The Terms of Service have been updated as of September 4th 2008 to state that you retain the rights and copyright on all things displayed with or through "The Service". The EULA is no longer a problem and I look forward to giving Chrome an in depth try. (See the EULA here:</strong><a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/eula.html" title="http://www.google.com/chrome/eula.html">http://www.google.com/chrome/eula. html</a>)</p>

<p>How often have you tried to install an application only to be stopped by a dialog asking you to agree to some terms of service (TOS), or an end user license agreement (EULA)?Now how often do you actually take the time to read through these terms to see what you're agreeing to?</p>

<!--more-->


<p>When I switched to Linux for my day to day computing I did not miss these constant reminders that my ability to use my computer was being impeded by some faceless corporate entity somewhere. I quickly became interested in the content of these agreements that I used to click through without a passing thought, and I was surprised at what I found.</p>

<p>Many of these agreements are almost exactly the same; they all contain the same boiler plate legalese defining the terms used in the agreement, and protecting the company from frivolous lawsuits. In the case of web services, the standard TOS will also protect the company from content you post on their service, as well as protect them from you should you find something objectionable on their service. Some sites which are used to archive or distribute your content on the web, such as deviantART, Flickr, or many Google services, also grant themselves royalty-free non-exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, or perform your works. This essentially prevents them from people who don't understand that in order to present this content to the web at large, they need to make a copy.</p>

<p>In the majority of cases, pieces of desktop software do not contain the same royalty-free distribution clauses as web applications (with the exception of software designed to use the web services) because they donâ€™t need your content. Theyâ€™ll still protect themselves from reverse-engineering and hacking, but not much else more.</p>

<p>However, when reading Google Chromeâ€™s terms of service I couldnâ€™t help but notice a slight difference. Unlike the desktop applications I was used to, this terms of service seems to treat the application like a service!</p>

<p>Throughout the document you're reminded of the rights granted to you while using the "Service". Nowhere in the document is a distinction made between Google Chrome and Googleâ€™s services. As a result we end up with some curious phrases granting some rather astonishing rights to Google.</p>

<p>Take the following for example:</p>

<blockquote><p>11. Content license from you</p>

<p>11.1 You retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in Content which you submit, post or display on or through, the Services. By submitting, posting or displaying the content you give Google a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute any Content which you submit, post or display on or through, the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling Google to display, distribute and promote the Services and may be revoked for certain Services as defined in the Additional Terms of those Services.</p></blockquote>

<p>What that says to me, is that any content I display or submit using Google Chrome I grant Google the right to use to display, distribute, and promote Google Chrome.</p>

<p>But wait, what if I use Google Chrome to access my web based source repository? Do I grant Google the right to display and distribute the source code viewed to promote their product? What if Iâ€™m an artist, and I preview some files for web viewing in Google Chrome. Do I grant Google the rights to these images for promotional purposes?</p>

<p>It is due to these concerns that I sent the following letter as part of my uninstall questionnaire:</p>

<blockquote><p>I am not happy with one fairly critical decision made for Chrome distribution: The Terms of Service.</p>

<p>I do not like the idea that Google Chrome will automatically download and update itself for me as described in the terms of service. In addition to the above, the overzealous use of the term "Service" to describe everything Google does, (presumably including Chrome since no language states otherwise) thereby granting Google trademark free and royalty free rights to my content is completely unacceptable.</p>

<p>While I do not believe that the Terms of Service were penned with malicious intent, but the danger is there and I must avoid it.</p>

<p>Other than the issues with the Terms of Service I found Chrome quite nice, but I can't risk sacrificing the rights to my content for the sake of a new web browser. Unfortunately that means my opinion of Chrome will only change when the Terms of Service do.</p>

<p>I can't help but think only semi-sarcastically, "Why does a project supposedly fueled with such an Open Source mindset have such a draconian license anyway?"</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Joseph Bauser</p></blockquote>

<p>While I'm positive the TOS was not penned with malicious intent, I can't use any product or service which grants such far-reaching rights to its creators. If Google chooses to modify their Terms of Service for Chrome, I'd be happy to give it an honest trial.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="/images/posts/2008/06/lovebugs.jpg" title="Geocaching: Love Bugs" ></p>

<p>What do you do when you have a GPS receiver, the internet, and a penchant for treasure hunting? You go Geocaching! Geocaching is a game where you quite literally use multi-million dollar satellites to hunt for boxes in the woods.</p>

<p>The game works as follows:
1. First you log into the Official Geocaching website (geocaching.com).
2. Enter your zip code to find all of the caches near where you live.
3. Put a few cache locations onto your GPS, and go hunting!</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/posts/2008/06/bluff2-300x225.jpg" title="View from a bluff" ></p>

<p>The caches themselves range in size from magnetic key holders to ammo boxes painted and marked with the word â€œGeocacheâ€. All caches contain a small logbook where finders can sign the date of their find, their nickname, and maybe even a quick description of the fun they had hunting.</p>

<p>Some of the larger caches are variable treasure troves of trinkets. Geocachers follow a policy of trade equal or trade up. This means that if you stumble upon a cache with a nifty goody you'd like to snag, you must trade that item for something of equal or greater value. This ensures the boxes stay stocked with things to keep everybody entertained.</p>

<p>The caches themselves vary in difficulty from easy to find, to incredibly hard. To make matters worse, since some people may frown upon the idea of geocaching, you generally must stay as inconspicuous as possible while caching. After all, the last thing you'd want to do is give away the cache to someone else hunting, or even worse be witnessed re-hiding the cache only to have it stolen.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/posts/2008/06/wheresjodo-225x300.jpg" title="Stump with Mushrooms" ></p>

<p>The number of people enjoying this interesting hobby is often surprising. Chances are if you're out caching you'll bump into another person doing the same. Caches are so wide spread that if you're anywhere any park, or city, chances are you walk right bye more than a few each day.</p>

<p>I began caching with a few friends from work known on geocaching.com as DrDonut and Raegx. Since then our caching adventures have taken us to various beautiful parks around the Rochester area. I've even revisited some of my favorite spots from high school only to discover caches present in the area.</p>

<p>The joy of the find and neat swag aside, the real fun of Geocaching comes from the community itself. The game itself is entirely community run. Geocachers make the caches and post them to the site. Geocachers find the caches. Geocachers police the caches and warn people when they need maintenance. But most importantly, geocachers all seem to be cut from the same adventurous cloth.</p>

<p>An overbearing theme for all caches seems to be to get you to look at your world a little differently. Many caches are placed in such a way that they will take you somewhere you might never know existed. Walking the trail, or even a bit off the beaten path, you're sure to see something cool and have a good deal of fun.</p>

<p>Happy caching!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After writing my <a href="/archive/2008/01/11/road-runner-high-speed-internet-http-redirecting-all-invalid-domains-requested/" title="My fist post describing the idiotic ">first post</a> describing Road Runner's annoying practice of redirecting all invalid DNS requests to their own advertising laden search page I opted out. I figured that would be the end of it.</p>

<p>I was wrong.</p>

<p>As of this morning Road Runner ha re-enabled the DNS redirecting again.</p>

<p>How stupid are they? At least now I know how much they actually actually care about their user's settings.</p>

<p>Road Runer, if you're reading this. Stop turning this feature on. It's absolute rubbish and I really don't want it. When I opt-out of a service this does NOT mean you should re-enable it a few months later and hope I won't notice.</p>
