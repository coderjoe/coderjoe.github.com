## The Game

Back in the Summer of 2010 Blizzard's iconic real time strategy game rebooted in
its first sequel, StarCraft 2: Wings of Liberty. Being a long time fan of the
real time strategy genre, and Blizzard's games in general, I had to pick it up.
I quickly found myself engrossed in the stragegy and skill based gameplay, the
nostalgic gameplay, and the budding videogame community surrounding the game.

One particular community, the Reddit community in the [/r/starcraft](https://reddit.com/r/starcraft)
subreddit, caught and kepy my attention. I found myself checking the site multiple
times a day. Fellow StarCraft fans would discuss StarCraft and StarCraft II in
depth and would share innovative new strategies and techniques as they were discovered.

## The Project

An existing solution for combining Starcraft II rankings with the reddit community
left me wanting, so I developed what I thought was a better integration.

Read more about the project at the original two blog posts:

2. [Official Rastarcraft.info Firefox Extension](/archive/2011/04/03/official-rstarcraft-info-firefox-extension)

## The Site Then and Now

The site was adopted by users faster than I had expected and resulted in a higher
than anticipated hosting bill. It was serving thousands of active users per month
and hundreds of thousands of rank requests per week. As one might expect, rank request, 
and API caching followed relatively quickly as the highest priorty features for
the site.

Site support ended in 2015 when automatic rank updates were disabled and the dynamic
site was converted to a static copy to support the few remaining plugin users.

Today I maintain the domain and the static site as a fun reminder of a project
completed.
